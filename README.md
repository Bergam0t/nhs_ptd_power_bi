# NHSRplotthedots - a PowerBI Custom Visual Implementation (with many thanks to NHS-R) <a alt="NHS-R Community's logo" href='https://nhsrcommunity.com/'><img src="https://nhs-r-community.github.io/assets/logo/nhsr-logo.png" align="right" height="80"/></a>

This is a custom visual for PowerBI to allow the generation of
statistical process control (SPC) charts.

![](man/figures/README-example-powerbi-rebase.png)

**!! At the moment this only works in the PowerBI desktop application -
while this may be useful for automating the reporting of some KPIs as it
is possible to export the resulting files to PDF, work is ongoing to
make this visual work in the PowerBI service so it can be used more
widely within organisations !!**

All calculations feeding into the visual are powered by R code written
by package is built by the [NHS-R community](https://nhsrcommunity.com)
in the NHSRplotthedots package.

This visual, like the R package, supports the NHSE/I programme [‘Making
Data Count’](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/making-data-count/),
and allows users to draw XmR charts, use change points, and apply rules
with summary indicators for when rules are breached.

Please see [‘Making Data Count’
programme](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/making-data-count/)
for more details about the precise flavour of XmR used.

> The programme encourages boards, managers, and analyst teams to
> present data in ways that show change over time, and drive better
> understanding of indicators than ‘RAG’ (red, amber, green) rated board
> reports often present.

# Using the PowerBI custom visual

The PowerBI visual itself can be downloaded from the **dist/** folder.
Save the .pbix file in there to any location on your computer.

The PowerBI custom visual can then be imported into PowerBI using the
option ‘more visuals’ –&gt; ‘From my files’.

At present, the input format is very restrictive and expects **all** of
the following headers, though some columns may be left blank:

Example datasets are given in **sample\_datasets/**

A csv template is given in **template\_dataset/**

An example PowerBI file is available in **pbi\_example\_file/**

The visual should appear in your list of available visuals. Click on the
icon to add a blank visual to the page. With the visual selected, drag
all fields from your dataset into your ‘values’ section.

![](man/figures/README-example-powerbi-variables.png)

At this stage, if you have more than one KPI in your dataset, you should
filter the dataset down to a single KPI using the built-in power BI
filters or a slicer to allow users to filter the KPI themselves.

The plot title and size, y axis title and x axis title can be set using
the ‘visual’ options. These changes will all be rendered using plotly.

![](man/figures/README-example-powerbi-custom-options.png)

Some additional options are available from PowerBI by clicking on
‘general’ within this menu. Depending on your version of PowerBI this
will allow you to add extra titles, subtitles, a heading colour and an
outline.

![](man/figures/README-example-powerbi-formatting.png)

## KPI Card

From the ‘Output Options’, select ‘Card’ to get a KPI card like the one
below.

Various options exist to allow you to tweak the positioning of the MDC
icons.

![](man/figures/README-example-kpi-card.png)

## KPI Matrix

If passing multiple KPIs, from the ‘Output Options’ select ‘Summary
Matrix’ to get a table like the one below.

This quickly summarises multiple KPIs, with the KPIs in the top left
corner generally being of most concern to decision-makers.

## KPI Summary Table

If passing multiple KPIs, from the ‘Output Options’ select ‘Summary
Table’ to get a table like the one below.

## Setting up development environment to build from source

A full tutorial will be written up at a later date.

In the meantime, details on setting up the required packages were
obtained from the following tutorials:

<https://medium.com/@thakurshalabh/create-dynamic-custom-visual-in-power-bi-using-r-ggplot2-and-plotly-4b15a73ef506>

It’s important to note that (as of June 2023) there is an error with the
most recent version of `powerbi-visuals-tools` has a bug that means that
compiled visuals will just render as blank.

Instead, when you reach this step in the tutorial, use the following to
get the most recent working version:

    npm i -g powerbi-visuals-tools@4.0.5

The following page should be consulted to see which versions of R
packages are currently suppported on the PowerBI service.
